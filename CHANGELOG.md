## 13.0.0

Recommended Gamevault App Version: `v1.12.5.0`

### Breaking Changes & Migration

**A lot** has changed in this version. Honestly, I’ve almost rewritten the entire codebase.

Please read the migration instructions below **BEFORE UPDATING**! (Migration instructions are marked **in bold**)

**For existing servers:** The migration process may take up to 30 minutes or even longer for larger servers. During this time, clients will not be able to use the server. The container may appear as UNHEALTHY after 5 minutes during a long migration, but don’t worry—let it run as long as logs are active. Be sure to disable any auto-heal processes for GameVault to avoid interruptions.

**After the migration:** The existing data might not be visible at first glance because we need to "merge" it. This could also take a while. Check the logs for inactivity before contacting us about this.

- Major database and codebase overhaul!
  - **I’ve done my best to migrate your existing data, but nobody’s perfect. Be sure to back up your data thoroughly before migrating, and contact us if you encounter any migration errors.**
- Some configurations and environment variables have changed.
  - **Ensure your environment variables are [configured correctly](https://gamevau.lt/docs/server-docs/configuration).**
- [#140](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/140): Introduced a new plugin framework that universally supports any metadata provider plugin and implemented a built-in IGDB Metadata Provider Plugin as the new default.
  - **This is necessary, as RAWG integration has been removed. Learn how to set up the IGDB plugin [here](https://gamevau.lt/docs/server-docs/metadata-enrichment/provider-igdb).**
  - **IGDB metadata is now prioritized over RAWG, as its data quality is superior. If you want your existing data to remain the primary source, set the `METADATA_IGDB_PRIORITY` environment variable to a value lower than `-10` before running the update.**
  - **We recommend first migrating the server to v13, then setting up IGDB and restarting, to minimize downtime.**
  - **Old experimental plugins are no longer supported. Remove them if you were using any (Spoiler: You probably weren’t).**
- Added support for more media types beyond just images. You can now upload audio and video files as well.
  - **You now need to mount your `/images` volume as `/media`.**
- Implemented parental control features. [#304](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/304)
  - **Learn how it works and how to set it up [here](https://gamevau.lt/docs/server-docs/parental-control).**
- Various API changes.
  - **Check the API documentation for any updates if you're using the REST API.**

### Changes

- Removed RAWG integration and all configurations for it.
- Removed Google Images Boxart Scraper. (Let's be honest, it was shit anyway.)
- Optimized the Game Indexer. It now usually only reads games that have changed instead of reading all files all the time.
- Optimized startup time.
- [#161](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/161) Implemented editing of games.
- [#423](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues/423) Implemented a `news.md` (a.k.a. Message of the Day) file and a `GET /config/news` API you can use to communicate news to your users. -> **Learn how to set it up [here](https://gamevau.lt/docs/server-docs/server-news).**
- Implemented a notes field in games.
- Implemented default launch parameters, default launch executable, and default installer file fields in games.

## 7.0.0

Recommended Gamevault App Version: `v1.6.1.0`

### Breaking Changes & Migration

- Case Insensitivity for Usernames and Emails:

  - Usernames and user emails are now treated as case-insensitive.
  - During the update to v7.0.0, a new database migration will check for users with conflicting usernames or emails caused by differences in letter casing.
  - If such conflicts are found, the migration will halt and report an error. This prevents the update to v7.0.0 until these conflicts are resolved.
  - Administrators are advised to revert to the previous GameVault version to address these conflicts and ensure a smooth transition to v7.0.0.

- Performance Enhancement: Removal of Progress Details and Filters from /games API:

  - To further enhance performance, the /games API no longer includes progress details and filters.

- Improved User Progress Handling:

  - User-related calls now include deleted game details in their progress information.
  - This enhancement allows for the correct display of progress even after a game has been deleted, ensuring a more comprehensive user experience.

- Fixed missing indexation game type getting detected as difference

### Thanks

- @Kairubyte
- @MarshyMadness

## 6.0.0

Recommended Gamevault App Version: `v1.6.0.0`

### Breaking Changes & Migration

- We've removed the outdated Utility APIs. Instead, please switch to using the more current replacements.
- We've removed the Tags, Genres, Developers, and Publisher details from entries on the /games API for performace Reasons. To get all details for a game use the /game/:id API
- Fuzzy Search for Tags, Genres, Developers, and Publishers has been eliminated. (Previously for example, searching for a Publisher like "Rockstar" would return "GTA V") This change was made to improve search performance (18x speed)

### Changes

- Fixed the default CORS configuration.
- Significantly enhanced the RAWG Search API, resulting in approximately 5 times faster performance and reduced data consumption. [#187](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/187). Previously, search results inadvertently generated numerous tags, genres, developers, and stores in your databases, as well as images on your filesystem. This is no longer the case. The RAWG Search now provides only essential game information for identification and remapping.
- Improved Search Performance.
- Enhanced Error-Handling during image downloads.
- Transitioned to the Debian `20.6-slim` docker image.
- Rectified "required/nullable" fields in the API Specification.
- Resolved the file title extraction issue. [#209](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues/209).
- Fixed the Broken Content-Disposition Header for some downloads. [#209](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues/209).
- Game Type only gets detected once, or when a game file changes and not on every index. [#200](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/200)
- Unified global error handler for 4XX and 5XX messages. The Problem is now directly inside the response without the duplicated status.
- Implemented `(NC)` flag to disable rawg-caching for single games. [#194](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues/194)

  - `USERS_REQUIRE_EMAIL` = true
  - `USERS_REQUIRE_FIRST_NAME` = true
  - `USERS_REQUIRE_LAST_NAME` = true

#### Removed Image Fields from Registration

- Removed all images from registration: To prevent spam attacks, we can't allow people to save images on your server without your permission. Therefore, we removed all image fields from registration.

### Changes

#### Runtime

- Updated to Node 20.6

#### Progress and Game Display

- Progress calls now include soft-deleted games, making it possible to display them correctly even after a game has been deleted.

#### Image Upload API

- Enhanced file upload security with Magic Bytes Checking for images.
- Modified the Game Release Date to be nullable. [Now, filenames can consist only of the game title, see Issue #180](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/180).
- Improved RAWG Matching Algorithm to use fewer calls to Rawg and work without Release Dates.
- Made Image Source URLs nullable and unique.
- Images are now saved with their correct file extensions.
- Limited image format support to bmp, jpeg, png, tiff, gif, and ico to ensure compatibility with WPF.
- Added `IMAGE_SUPPORTED_IMAGE_FORMATS`, you can change the supported Content-Type Headers for images with this parameter if you have a non WPF Client.
- Removed unused Image Garbage Collector configurations (`IMAGE_GC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` & `IMAGE_GC_KEEP_DAYS`).

#### API Specification

- Added `@ApiBasicAuth()` to all APIs except Health API #186

#### Bandwidth Control

- Implemented server-side bandwidth limit configuration `SERVER_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BANDWIDTH_IN_KBPS` to control the server's maximum bandwidth. [See Issue #10](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-backend/issues/10).
- Added client-side bandwidth limit configuration through the `X-Download-Speed-Limit` Header in Download Requests.

#### Admin Features

- Admins now have the ability to delete the progress of other users by using the Progress ID.

#### RAWG Cache

- Changed the default RAWG Cache retention period from 7 days to 30 days since game data doesn't change frequently.

#### Database Changes

- Migrated Email, First Name, and Last Name as nullable fields in the database.
- Implemented Conditional Validators to ensure that only registrations matching the required user information configuration are accepted, denying registrations that don't meet the configuration criteria.
- Refactored the Configuration Class for improved organization and readability.
- First And Last Name fields now support German Umlauts (like ä,ö,ü, etc.).
- Added `RAWG_API_EXCLUDE_STORES` Config Parameter for Itch.io Indie-Game Lovers.
- Set RAWG API Calls to look for games on all Platforms & Consoles and not just PC.
- Fixed a bug where Boxarts couldn't be found for certain games because the search effort was insufficient.
- Added nullable uploader field to Image Enity and uploaded_images field to User Entity for traceability.

## 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes & Migration

- Removed `(DP)` Direct Play flag. Use `(W_P)` instead. (It wasn't officially implemented yet but some of you may saw it in the docs)
- Removed `SERVER_PORT` Environment variable as it makes no sense to make it configurable inside the container. Just map your desired port to the containers 8080.
- Switched from an Alpine-based container to a Debian-based container, resulting in a fourfold increase in image size but enabling the server to use `7zip`.

### Changes

- Upgraded Dependencies to the latest version.
- Introduced game types a broad Enum, allowing better classification across different platforms and installation types.
- Implemented autodetection of the Game Type (Windows Portable or Windows Setup) based on the archive contents.
- Added a Game Type Override Flag (W_P) or (W_S) to manually set the type of wrongly detected games, simplifying the client installation process.
- Expanded GameVault support to all archive formats supported by `7zip`, enhancing compatibility with various game archives. (Including .iso)
- Added the ability to provide a custom list of file formats through a comma seperated list of format in the `GAMES_SUPPORTED_FILE_FORMATS` environment variable , allowing tailoring of supported formats according to specific needs.
- Polished the API specification for improved code generation.
- Implemented the `GAMES_SEARCH_RECURSIVE` configuration variable (default true), toggling the Indexer's search for games in subfolders of the `/files` directory.
- Changed the 404 error on the `/` path to a more descriptive message indicating that the web UI is not yet available.
- Prettified the response of `/api/v1/health`.
- Support for custom `PUID` & `PGID` via environment variables.
- Disabled Content Security Policies on Web UI so `/api/docs` load for everyone.

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes & Migration

- GameVault Rebranding:
  - If your previous `DB_DATABASE` or `DB_USERNAME` was set as `Crackpipe` (default), please adjust the Environment Variables or make the necessary SQL modifications to ensure the app's functionality.
  - Update your docker/ghcr images to "gamevault-backend" as there will be no further updates for `crackpipe-backend`
  - For SQLITE users, rename your database file to `database.sqlite`, the new default
  - Please switch off `DB_SYNCHRONIZE` if you had set it to true manually, because the migrations will take over controlled database changes from now on.

### Changes

- Implemented database migrations for postgresql and sqlite.
- `DB_SYNCHRONIZE` is now false by default.
- New Configuration: `SERVER_LOG_FILES_ENABLED` is now set to false by default.
- Games API now supports the `contains` filter.
- Non-root global npm packages have been added to the Dockerfile.
- Introduced a new Log Level: `off`

## 1.1.0

### Breaking Changes

- When adding the same game multiple times to your GameVault server, [follow this documentation.](https://gamevau.lt/docs/server-docs/adding-games#adding-the-same-game-multiple-times)

### Changes

- Various improvements have been made to indexing, restoring, and updating games.
- Thanks to the use of Node 20 the `/files` directory is now readable recursively, allowing you to create sub-folders in `/files` for better organization.
- Fixed File-Size being returned as a number when SQLITE is being used as Database.
- The Game Indexer now has a failsafe mechanism. If it encounters any incorrect file, it will generate a log and skip it.
- Images are now optional for registering a user
